  # if no alias is specified with =alias, the key value is used
  # for instance below, _domain_ and _format_ will be used 
  # as field names, whereas _title_ will be used for _parse.title_.
  # You can specify the index of the value to store from the values array 
  # by using the _key[index]_ format, e.g. _parse.title[0]_ would try to 
  # get the first value for the metadata _parse.title_ (which is the default anyway).
  # Finally, you can use a glob (*) to match all the keys, e.g. _parse.*_ would
  # index all the keys with _parse_ as a prefix. Note that in that case, you can't
  # specify an alias with =, nor can you specify an index.
