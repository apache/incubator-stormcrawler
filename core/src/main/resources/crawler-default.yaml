  # by using the _key[index]_ format, e.g. _parse.title[0]_ would try to 
  # get the first value for the metadata _parse.title_ (which is the default anyway).
  # Finally, you can use a glob (*) to match all the keys, e.g. _parse.*_ would
  # index all the keys with _parse_ as a prefix. Note that in that case, you can't
  # specify an alias with =, nor can you specify an index.
