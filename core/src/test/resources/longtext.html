			<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%" align="left">
			<span style="line-height: 200%"><font size="5">As has often (and 
			rightly) been pointed out, the best college or university is the one 
			that is the best fit for a given prospective student. The school 
			with the greatest prestige, the biggest endowment, the most 
			resources, the greatest financial aid, the highest achieving student 
			body, the highest retention and graduation rates, the faculty with 
			the most academic awards and publications, the smallest 
			faculty-to-student ratios, and the alumni with the highest average 
			salary is not necessarily going to be the best fit for every 
			student. (Although that may sound tongue-in-cheek, let not my 
			readers take it as such.) </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%" align="left">
			<span style="line-height: 200%"><font size="5">Lists cannot account 
			for a number of variables in the equation for determining the right 
			fit for a given student. Location (especially proximity to one’s 
			home) may be more important to a student’s needs than various other 
			assets of high-end colleges. Moreover, any given prospective student 
			may thrive more in a less academically competitive environment (the 
			big-fish-in-a-little-pond phenomenon). Increasingly in our culture 
			there is this factor: A religiously or politically conservative 
			student may prosper more and experience much less unhealthy stress 
			and hostility in an academic environment (and student body) more 
			congenial to his or her own views. (I am speaking as someone who, 
			though religiously and politically conservative, did not take that 
			route in my student days.) For that matter, a morally weak student 
			can be harmed by the sexually loose lifestyle and the one-sided 
			left-wing tilt (did I say tilt? I meant pell-mell headlong drive) of 
			the vast majority of colleges and universities today, including the 
			most highly rated ones. </font></span>
			</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%" align="left">
			<span style="line-height: 200%"><font size="5">Many of the best (and 
			worst) institutions of the country are increasingly bent on 
			restricting the free speech and free thought of those with more 
			“traditional” views. Classrooms can become hostile environments and 
			social life in such institutions lonely, if one cannot connect with 
			groups that share an ideological (moral, religious, political, 
			social) affinity. Apart from all this, a potential applicant’s 
			presumed major or career objective may dispose him or her to a 
			generally less prestigious institution of higher learning that 
			happens to be a strong match for his or her set of interests. In 
			some cases professors who have not published extensively may spend 
			more time both mentoring students and developing teaching skills 
			(though there is some correlation between publications and teaching 
			content). In short, the “optimal learning environment” can vary 
			greatly from one student to the next.</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%" align="left">
			<span style="line-height: 200%"><font size="5">So even if a “best 
			colleges” list or lists accurately reflected what were the best 
			colleges from the standpoint of a limited set of criteria, it would 
			not necessarily pose a <i>fait accompli</i> for the potential 
			applicant: “I have to apply to the top schools! I just have to 
			apply!” </font></span>
			</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%" align="left">
			<span style="line-height: 200%"><font size="5">As it is, lists are 
			far from perfect indicators of what the overall best schools are 
			(even judged from limited criteria). Lists differ in significant 
			ways from each other, depending on what elements a given list 
			stresses. Lists that factor in the opinions of others (college 
			administrators, alumni, current students) are rampant with 
			subjectivity (though a school's reputation cannot be discounted in 
			hiring and grad school admissions).
			</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%" align="left">
			<span style="line-height: 200%"><font size="5">Some schools have 
			learned how to manipulate rankings through various means ranging 
			from outright lying to fudging data (for example, not reporting the 
			test scores of international students) or altering data through 
			unscrupulous admissions practices (for example, encouraging large 
			numbers of students to apply who have little or no hope of being 
			admitted, as a means to improving the institution’s admissions 
			selectivity; or wait-listing large numbers of students whom the 
			admissions office believes will go elsewhere, so as not to damage 
			yield rates). Critiques of college rankings (particularly
			<i>US News</i>) are legion. Go </font></span>

			<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%" align="left">
			<span style="line-height: 200%"><font size="5">That having been 
			said, lists of “best colleges” have their benefits (don’t think that 
			I didn’t give serious consideration to putting my title’s “top 
			colleges” in quotation marks). For all their differences, there is a 
			general recognition that some schools typically rise toward the top 
			because of name recognition, resources, and overall academic 
			quality. A composite list such as the one provided here can minimize 
			the biases and idiosyncrasies of any one list. Lists provide a 
			general consensus, backed up with some hard data, regarding which 
			schools are more likely to provide quality education. </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%" align="left">
			<span style="line-height: 200%"><font size="5">One can’t visit or 
			give careful scrutiny to every school. Lists of “best colleges” 
			(and, I think, especially this composite list) can help students 
			narrow down their search and perhaps elevate their vision of the 
			kind of institutions that they might dare to consider. Even though I 
			came from a low-income family with little post-secondary education 
			experience (neither of my parents completed a college education), I 
			found that attending academically high-end schools provided me with 
			various benefits that I don’t think I would have received had I 
			attended less challenging institutions (fair disclosure: I have a 
			B.A. from Dartmouth, a masters from Harvard, and a Ph.D. from 
			Princeton Theological Seminary which, incidentally, is not part of 
			Princeton University though they share a historical relationship).</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%" align="left">
			<span style="line-height: 200%"><font size="5">While being a big 
			fish in a small pond may have its benefits, so too does being in an 
			academically challenging environment where the overall quality of 
			professors and fellow students can raise one’s standards of 
			intellectual inquiry. Increasingly, too, some of the most 
			prestigious colleges and universities are also becoming the most 
			inexpensive for students whose parents make less than $100,000 per 
			year.</font></span></p>

			number of different subjects taught” at the college; source:

			IPEDS</a>). Of the remaining three sections, 
			<b>40%</b> is allotted to
		<b><i>Outcomes</i></b>, which involves graduation rates (11%; source: 
			IPEDS), “value added to graduate salary” 10 years after entering 
			college (12%) and “value added to the loan repayment rate” as a 
			percentage of “students who have repaid some portion of their loans” 
			(7%),** and “academic reputation” (10%; “based on <i>Times Higher 
			Education</i>’s annual Academic Reputation Survey, a survey of 
			leading scholars”). Then
			<b>30%</b> is allotted to <b><i>Resources</i></b>, including “the 
			amount of money each institution spends on teaching per student,” 
			both undergraduate and graduate programs (11%; source: IPEDS), “the 
			ratio of students to faculty members” (11%; source: IPEDS), and “the 
			number of published scholarly research papers [source: Elsevier] per 
			faculty [source: IPEDS]” 2011-2015 (8%). Finally, <b>10%</b> is

			college ranking (2015) is an ‘outlier ranking’ that puts the 
			emphasis not so much on how much a university or college benefits 
			any given enrolled student as on what schools give back to society. 
			This involves three components: (a) Social mobility, defined as 
			“recruiting and graduating low-income students” (determined by the 
			percentage of Pell grant recipients) at a reasonable price (a 
			“cost-adjusted graduation measure” defined as the difference between 
			the “actual” and “predicted”&nbsp; graduation rates, divided by the 
			net price of attendance); (b) Service, measured by the number of 
			alumni serving the Peace Corps, the size of the ROTC program, and 
			the percentage of federal work-study grant money spent on community 
			service projects; and (c) Research, based on the amount of research 
			spending, the number of science and engineering PhDs awarded, the 
			proportion of alumni who have gone on to receive a PhD, the 
			proportion of faculty receiving prestigious awards and having 
			membership in national academies.</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%" align="left">
			<span style="line-height: 200%"><font size="5">I had two main 
			problems with the list that led me to drop it. First, it was 
			difficult to make use of the separate list for liberal arts colleges 
			because the five research categories used to evaluate national 
			research universities were scaled down to two for liberal arts 
			colleges. Even the best liberal arts colleges cannot match the top 
			200 research universities in research expenditure and PhDs awarded 
			(and perhaps also faculty awards and academy memberships). Second, I 
			had serious reservations about using the
			<i>WM</i> ranking for helping students to assess which are the best 
			schools to send an application. Schools that have low graduation 
			rates are rewarded over schools with high graduation rates because 
			it is easier for the former to exceed a low <i>predicted</i> 
			graduation rate. As far as net price is concerned, there is no 
			factoring in of the “free ride” that many Ivy League schools offer 
			students with family income low enough to qualify for Pell grants. 
			Furthermore, why having a larger number of students in ROTC or of 
			alumni serving in the Peace Corps makes a school a more attractive 
			choice to an applicant is not clear, particularly since such 
			involvement will always account for only a small percentage of the 
			total student body and alumni. Frankly, there is something wrong 
			with a list that rates UCal San Diego first, UCal Riverside second, 
			and Texas A&amp;M third among national universities while ranking 
			Princeton twenty-sixth, Duke thirty-first, UPenn thirty-seventh, 
			Yale forty-forth, Caltech forty-seventh, Columbia forty-ninth, 
			UChicago fifty-fifth, Dartmouth sixty-forth, Northwestern 
			one-hundred-sixth, and Brown one-hundred-thirteenth.</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%" align="left">
			<span style="line-height: 200%"><font size="5">As regards <b>how I 
			tallied the cumulative scores</b>, I began by dropping a non-ranking 
			score (whether because of insufficient data or because the school 
			ranked below the list’s limited number of schools); if all lists 
			ranked the school in question, I did a strikethrough of the largest 
			(i.e. worst) number, the negative outlier. This left nine scores to 
			add. If all ten lists ranked the school in question I put that 
			cumulative score in parentheses. When a school had a higher (worse) 
			number with one dropped list than another school but a lower 
			(better) number when no lists were dropped, I generally resolved the 
			problem by assessing which school “won” the most head-on comparisons 
			in mutually shared lists. When there was a tie I compared each 
			school’s SAT and ACT scores. There were further qualifications: </font></span>

			<span style="line-height: 200%"><font size="5">(1) The reader will 
			notice that I first add the two scores from <i>US News</i> and <i>
			College Choice</i>, then multiply by two; for liberal arts colleges 
			I then add an additional 30. Why? Both rankings have two separate 
			lists for research universities and liberal arts colleges. There is 
			no perfect way of merging each of the two lists into one each. For 
			research universities I decided to multiply the ranking for a given 
			school by two in order to adjust for incorporation into a list that 
			also contained liberal arts colleges. For liberal arts colleges I 
			not only multiplied by two but also added 15 points to each of the 
			two lists. I did so because I found that rankings in a list of 
			liberal arts colleges averaged 15.8 points higher (better) than the 
			average rating for the same school in composite lists consisting of 
			both national research universities and liberal arts colleges. In 
			other words liberal arts colleges on average drop 15.8 points lower 
			on composite lists than do national research universities. </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%" align="left">
			<span style="line-height: 200%"><font size="5">(2) I did not drop 
			the scores from <i>US News, College Choice</i>, <i>Forbes</i>, and <i>
			WSJ/THE 
			</i>even if they were among the worst scores. This was in part a nod 
			to the significance of the <i>US News</i>, <i>Forbes</i>, and <i>

			The <i>PayScale College ROI Report</i> offers <i>both</i> an 
			in-state rank and an out-of-state rank. I used the out-of-state rank 
			in <i>PayScale ROI</i> for ordering public/state universities but in 
			each case note as well what the ranking of the given school would be 
			if the in-state <i>PayScale ROI</i> rank were adopted. The GCR is 
			thus a composite of both rankings that factor in-state net price for 
			public universities and rankings that factor out-of-state net price. 
			There are good arguments for both methods of evaluating cost. In 
			favor of an in-state consideration is the fact that the overwhelming 
			majority of students at public state schools are in-state (e.g., at 
			UCal Berkeley, 85% of the students are in-state). In favor of an 
			out-of-state pricing is the fact that a comparison is being made 
			with national private universities and colleges. If public 
			universities are to be treated as
			<i>national</i> universities, they ought to be evaluated on an 
			out-of-state basis. Potential applicants will be able to get (at 
			most) one or two in-state prices for the roughly 50 public 
			universities included in this list. It is unhelpful to clutter a 
			list with rankings based in part on net prices of which only a tiny 
			percentage of the national applicant pool can take advantage. </font></span></p>

			<font size="5">(8) At the end I supply <b>world rankings</b>, which 
			taken as a composite listing will often look very different from the 
			U.S. national rankings (though Harvard is still 1<sup>st</sup>, not 
			only in terms of relative placement of U.S. schools but also in the 
			world). The differences are due to a
			<a style="color: #22589B; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none; text-line-through: none" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_and_university_rankings">
			difference in variables</a>. World rankings do not take into account 
			a university’s selectivity (which foreign universities don’t 
			measure; even if they did, they obviously don’t make use of SAT and 
			ACT scores). Nor do they evaluate earning potential (there are 
			obvious difficulties in such comparisons across different cultures). 
			Instead they typically focus on such things as global reputation, 
			the number of articles published by faculty (particularly in top 
			science journals) and (to a lesser extent) books, citations of such 
			publications globally by other researchers, major awards won by 
			faculty (e.g., Nobel prizes, Field Medals in Mathematics), PhDs 
			awarded, and internationals among staff and students (see, for 
			example, the methodology of <i>
			<a style="color: #22589B; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none; text-line-through: none" href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/methodology-world-university-rankings-2016-2017">

			US News</a></i>). These variables, including an emphasis on 
			quantity, put nearly all small U.S. liberal arts colleges at a 
			distinct disadvantage in relation to research universities, 
			resulting in the former’s rare appearance on world lists. The 
			variables also favor universities that have a heavy focus on 
			engineering and science, which explains why MIT and Cal Tech beat 
			out Princeton. As with some U.S. listings (notably <i>USNews</i>) 
			there are complaints about subjectivity in factoring reputation. The <i>
			Times Higher Education</i> (London) did a list jointly with QS (Quacquarelli 
			Symonds, also a London-based corporation; they specialize in study 
			abroad) from 2004 to 2009 (with QS providing the data), then split 
			off from QS because of complaints of too much reliance on subjective 
			reputation assessments by QS (surveys of academics and recruiters 
			account for 50% of the rating). <i>THE</i> now collaborates with 
			Thomson Reuters for data collection (academic reputation still 
			accounts for 15% weighting). The <i>THE</i> World University 
			Rankings is generally viewed with the highest regard. Since 2011 <i>
			THE</i> has also put out a World Reputation Rankings which surveys 
			over 13,000 academics in over 130 countries (“<a style="color: #22589B; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none; text-line-through: none" href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2015/reputation-ranking#!/page/0/length/25">the

			the first such US ranking. They too make use of data from Thomson 
			Reuters.&nbsp;</font></p>

			For <i>Campus Pride</i> the higher the score, the better the

			an institution’s promotion of sexually immoral behavior and of its 
			dishonoring of the gendered self (a denial of the fundamental 
			reality in nature that the only true sexual counterpart to a man is 
			a woman and to a woman a man), but also of its oppressive 
			intolerance toward those who believe in the importance of sexual 
			complementarity for marriage and in the integrity of one’s birth 
			sex. Such institutions typically foster a hostile environment, 
			equating moral qualms about homosexual practice and so-called 
			transgenderism with racism. The usual result is a denial of freedom 
			of speech and thought, religious liberty, and due process. It can 
			also surface in practices of coercive indoctrination, shaming, 
			ostracism, and various sanctions for alleged bias and unreasonably 
			broad interpretations of what constitutes harassment. This 
			intimidation may occur in classrooms, regular convocations, media,

			providing special scholarships for such; special retention efforts

			LGBTQ students, with paid staff responsible for LGBTQ “support 
			services”; maintaining “an ongoing Safe Zone, Safe Space and/or Ally 
			training program that are offered at a minimum annually to educate 
			students, faculty and/or staff on LGBTQ issues and concerns”; having 
			a “standing advisory committee that deals with LGBTQ issues,” an 
			“LGBTQ alumni group,” an “LGBTQ faculty/staff organization,” “LGBTQ 
			&amp; Ally student organizations,” an “LGBTQ fraternity/sorority,” and 
			“LGBTQ-inclusive career services”; having an LGBTQ studies program

			incorporate LGBTQ issues into existing courses” and to “address 
			[negatively] heteronormativity and gender normativity in the 
			curriculum/classroom”; amply stocking libraries with LGBTQ-affirming 
			books and periodicals; implementing a program for “training” all new 
			faculty and staff to affirm homosexuality and transgenderism; 
			embracing “non-discrimination” (affirmation) statements &nbsp;concerning 
			“sexual orientation” and “gender identity”; mandating that “senior 
			administrators (e.g., chancellor, president, vice-president, 
			academic deans, senior diversity officer) attend campus LGBTQ 
			events/activities in a visible, ongoing manner” and “explicitly 
			include the terms ‘sexual orientation,’ ‘gender identity/expression’ 
			and ‘lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender’ when publicly 
			discussing multicultural and/or diversity issues on campus”; 
			developing a “simple process” for students to change their name and 
			gender identity (requiring all to use the new name, e.g., calling a 
			man Sally or a woman David, even in the absence of any legal change 
			or “sex-reassignment” surgery) and to specify what pronouns apply to 
			them; having a “procedure for reporting LGBTQ related bias incidents 
			and hate crimes,” “active ongoing training for hate crime 
			prevention,” and training campus police on sexual orientation and 
			gender identity issues; as regards housing issues, setting aside 
			“LGBTQ living space, theme floors and/or living-learning community,” 
			offering “roommate matching for LGBTQ students to find LGBTQ-friendly 
			roommate,” “gender-inclusive housing,” “gender-inclusive/single 
			occupancy restroom” restroom and shower facilities, and residence 
			life staff trained to address affirmatively all “LGBTQ issues and 
			concerns”; having “</font></span><font size="4">LGBTQ 
			counseling/support groups,” “trans-inclusive trained counseling 
			staff,” “free, anonymous and accessible HIV/STI testing,” 
			“LGBTQ-inclusive health information and safer sex materials 
			available,” and a “trans-inclusive student health insurance policy 
			which covers ongoing counseling services” and “hormone replacement 
			therapy.” In other words, at every level of university or college 
			life, there is a stranglehold insistence on catering to every 
			homosexual and transsexual wish and co-opting every conscience for 
			this purpose.</font></p>

				<p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst" style="line-height: 200%; margin-right: -.1in" align="left">
				<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Princeton is a financial 
				aid marvel. In <b>2014-15</b> it ranked <b>an impressive second 
				in lowest average net price</b> among the top 133 GCR schools <b>
				for <i>beginning</i> undergrads 
				</b>receiving any financial aid (surpassed only by Harvard; 
				Princeton was <b>fourth in 2013-14</b>). [This ranking, compiled 
				from NCES figures adjusted for standard expenses, does not 
				factor in private outside scholarships; when factored in (using 
				CDS figures), Princeton ranked first in 2014-15 (but stats not 
				yet available for competitors Harvard and Columbia).] Broken 
				down into parental salary levels, <b>in 2014-15</b> for 
				beginning undergrads it ranked an impressive <b>third for 
				incomes $0-$30,000</b> 
				(2013-14: fifth), <b>fourth for $30,001-$48,000</b> (2013-14:

				seventh for $75,001-$110,000</b> (2013-14: fourth; compiled from 
				adjusted NCES figures). For <i>all</i> undergrads receiving any 
				financial aid in 2014-15 (compiled from CDS figures that factor 
				in private outside scholarships) it ranked an impressive first 
				(stats not available for Harvard and Columbia). As for average 
				net price in
				<b>2015-16</b> (private outside scholarships factored in) it 
				ranked an impressive <b>first both for beginning undergrads and 
				for all undergrads</b> (but stats not yet available for

				<p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst" style="line-height: 200%; margin-right: -.1in" align="left">
				<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the original no-loan 
				college in America, Princeton's<b> average student loan at 
				graduation</b> 
				for that portion of the Class of 2015 taking out any loans <b>
				was the <i>lowest</i> </b>among the GCR top 139 schools; and <b>
				the percentage of students graduating with debt was also the 
				lowest</b> (edging out Yale by a single point). Princeton 
				expects 
				<b>no parental contribution for families making less than 
				$60,000</b> and offers <b>free tuition for families making less 
				than $140,000</b>. 
				</font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="line-height: 200%">
				<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Princeton’s other stats 
				are also amazing. Princeton has <b>the highest endowment per 
				student</b> (undergrad + grad) in the nation, the third highest 
				per undergrad-only (behind Harvard and Yale), and the fourth 
				highest endowment for a single institution in the nation 
				(possibly in the world; last year [2015] it overtook Stanford 
				but Stanford inched ahead this year). On top of all this, 
				Princeton (the second smallest of the Ivies) has <b>the third 
				lowest student-to-faculty ratio </b>(behind only MIT and 
				Caltech). It also has
				<b>the second highest 6-year graduation rate</b> (behind only 
				Harvard), and the f<b>ourth highest 4-year graduation rate</b> 
				(higher than all other Ivies, Stanford, MIT, and Duke). In 
				addition to its seventh place rank in PayScale’s ROR, it is 
				rated <b>third highest (tie) in Mid-Career Salary</b>.</font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="line-height: 200%">
				<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As one might expect, 
				Princeton is highly selective and desirable, with the <b>fourth 
				highest yield rate</b> 
				(68%), <b>fifth lowest acceptance rate</b> (7%), and <b>fifth 
				best selectivity (desirability) index</b>. With respect to test 
				scores for entering freshmen, it is tied for the <b>fifth 
				highest SAT scores</b> (with Writing; eighth without Writing) 
				and <b>third highest ACT</b> composite score (6-way tie). 
				Perhaps it will be surprising to many that it has the 
				<b>ninth highest African-American student representation</b>, 
				with only three GCR top 30 schools ahead of it (Amherst, Duke, 
				and Vanderbilt; tied with Williams) and tops in the Ivies. The 
				only major statistic in which Princeton falls below the top 10 
				is in its
				<b>first-year retention rate</b> (just barely: <b>eleventh</b>, 
				tied) and even that figure is impressive (97.4%).</font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="line-height: 200%">
				<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only areas of 
				disappointment for conservative-to-moderate students will be 
				Princeton’s unfortunate ‘red light’ rating from FIRE for having 
				“at least one policy that both clearly and substantially 
				restricts freedom of speech” and its selection by “<i>Campus 
				Pride</i>” as one of the “Top 25 LGBTQ-Friendly Colleges and 
				Universities in 2015” (with a 4.5 out of 5 evaluation). In its 
				Orientation Week entering students are forced to sit through 
				indoctrination sessions promoting sexual promiscuity and the 
				homosexual/transgender agenda. </font></p>

				<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ivy League schools are

				Wilson's racist views</a> (Wilson was President of Princeton 
				before becoming NJ governor and then US President). One of their 
				demands was to remove Wilson's name from the prestigious School 
				of Public and International Affairs and the first of its 
				residential colleges, even though Wilson (in other respects a 
				&quot;progressive&quot; of his day) was being honored for his positive 
				contributions, not his racism. (A possible inconsistency on the 
				part of student protestors: They tolerate the fact that our 
				country's capital, which also contains the Washington Monument, 
				and the state of Washington are named after a slaveholder.)

				Some concessions</a> were made immediately by the administration 
				and no disciplinary actions were taken against the occupiers 
				(would pro-life or pro-natural-marriage protestors occupying the 
				president's office have received the same amnesty?). The move by 
				the protestors did not have universal support (see this
				<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/427567/princeton-students-push-back-against-politically-correct-intimidation-campus">

				<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>The highest-ranked 
				non-Ivy school</b>, Stanford's ratings are quite impressive. <b>
				In three of the rankings lists, Stanford is rated no. 1 </b>(<i>Forbes, </i>
				up slightly from last year's third; <i>Wall St. Journal/Times 
				Higher Education</i>; and 
				<i>Niche</i>, same as 2016's and 2015's) and in <b>five more</b> 
				it is rated <b>fourth</b> (<i>College Choice </i>for national 
				universities; <i>College Raptor</i>, same as last year; and 
				<i>PayScale ROI</i>, down slightly from last year's third) <b>or 
				fifth</b> (<i>US News </i>for national universities and USA 
				Today's<i> College Factual</i>, both down slightly from last 
				year's fourth). Its <b>fourth</b>-place rank in 
				<i>PayScale ROI </i>is highest among the non-tech schools. Its 
				two lowest rankings are <b>tenth</b> (<i>Money</i>, down 
				significantly from last year's first-place rank; what happened 
				in one year?) and a puzzling 
				<b>twentieth</b> 
				(<i>Kiplinger</i>, a list that emphasizes affordability; up 
				slightly from 2016's twenty-first and same as 2015's twentieth; 
				perhaps relatively low rating due to Stanford's twenty-fifth 
				place student debt rank, in addition to relatively weak 
				graduation rates). <i>US News</i> also ranks Stanford #10 in
				<a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/undergraduate-teaching">
				Best Undergraduate Teaching among National Universities</a>. In the GCR composite list of the top six <b>
				world rankings</b> it averages <i><b>second </b></i>in the 
				world, behind only Harvard.</font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst" align="left" style="line-height: 200%">
				<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A case could be made for 
				ranking Stanford just ahead of Princeton this year (last year 
				the ranking of Princeton and Stanford was reversed), or at least 
				in a tie, since it edges out Princeton in six of the ten lists. 
				However, Princeton has the better overall score: 34 (43) 
				compared to Stanford's 43 (64). At the same time, a case could 
				be made for ranking Yale ahead of Stanford, or at least in a 
				tie, since it edges out Stanford in five of the nine lists and 
				bests Stanford by one point when the lowest score is dropped 
				(but lags behind by two points when all rankings are considered: 
				42 [66]).</font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle" align="left" style="line-height: 200%">
				<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stanford University 
				doesn't take kindly to the condescending title of “the Harvard 
				of the West” (rather, Harvard is “the Stanford of the East” they 
				would argue). It dominates the Western educational landscape in 
				a way that Harvard cannot dominate the eastern educational 
				landscape, given the plethora of top-rated eastern 
				establishments. Aside from the small seventh-place Caltech 
				(which competes with Stanford only in math and the sciences), 
				Stanford’s closest rival in the entire West is geographically 
				distant Rice University (twelfth) and on the West Coast Pomona 
				(fifteenth), UCal Berkeley (twenty-second), Harvey Mudd 
				(twenty-third), UCLA (thirty-sixth), Claremont McKenna 
				(thirty-seventh), and USC (forty-eighth). In other words, 
				Stanford has only six competitors on the West Coast in the GCR 
				Top 50, just half of which are in the Top 25 and only one of 
				which is in the Top 15. This and the beautiful weather help to 
				explain why <b>Stanford is ranked as the most desirable school 
				in the country to attend, at least as indicated by its lowest 
				acceptance rate, highest yield, and thus best selectivity index</b>, 
				edging out Harvard slightly (which gets about 7500 fewer 
				applications than Stanford for an entering class only 60 
				students smaller). </font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst" style="line-height: 200%; margin-right: -.1in" align="left">
				<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for affordability, 
				Stanford ranked an impressive <b>sixth in lowest average net 
				price</b> 
				among the top 133 GCR schools <b>for <i>beginning</i> undergrads</b> 
				receiving any financial aid <b>in 2014-15</b> (third in 
				2013-14). This ranking does not factor in private outside 
				scholarships; factored in, Stanford still ranks sixth (but stats 
				not available for Harvard and Columbia). Broken down into 
				parental salary levels, in 2014-15 for beginning undergrads it 
				ranked a truly impressive <b>second for incomes $0-$30,000</b> 
				(2013-14: third), <b>first for $30,001-$48,000
				</b>(2013-14: fifth), <b>second for $48,001-$75,000</b> 
				(2013-14: sixth), and 
				<b>second for $75,001-$110,000</b> (2013-14: eighth).&nbsp; <b>
				For 
				<i>all</i> 
				undergrads</b> receiving any financial aid <b>in 2014-15</b> 
				(compiled from CDSs that factor in private outside scholarships) 
				it ranked an impressive <b>fifth</b> (stats not available for 
				Harvard and Columbia). Stanford's <b>average student loan at 
				graduation</b> for that portion of the Class of 2015 taking out 
				any loans was a surprising <b>thirty-eighth lowest</b> among the 
				GCR top 139 schools; the <b>percentage of students graduating 
				with debt was the third lowest</b> (4-way tie).&nbsp; Stanford 
				expects 
				<b>no parental contribution for families making less than 
				$65,000</b>, offers <b>free tuition for families earning less 
				than $125,000</b>, and offers <b>no-loan financial aid packages 
				for all s</b>tudents who receive financial aid. 
				</font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst" align="left" style="line-height: 200%">
				<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There isn’t much that 
				Stanford doesn’t do well in, though it is particularly 
				exceptional (top 6) in its student selectivity (noted above), <b>
				first-year retention rate (6-way tie for third), endowment 
				(third </b>in the US and third or fourth in the world; fourth 
				both per undergrad and per undergrad + grad student), and 
								<b>student-to-faculty ratio (perhaps 5-way tie 
				for fifth</b>, though the figures are disputed). It is also 
				strong (seventh to tenth) in its <b><i>PayScale 
				</i>Mid-Career<i> </i>rating (fifth)</b>, test scores (<b>SAT: 
				ninth</b> 
								without the Writing component, tied for <b>tenth</b> 
								with it; <b>ACT: 5-way tie for tenth</b>), and 
								<b>percentage of African-American students (only 
				thirty-eighth</b>, a point-and-a-half off of Princeton’s Ivy 
				League high but vastly higher than California schools 
				generally). Areas where 
								<b>it underperforms </b>significantly in 
				relation to its exalted overall rank are <b>its 6-year 
				graduation rate (twenty-second) and</b> above all its relatively 
				dismal <b>4-year graduation rate (eighty-fourth)</b>.

				abuse and arbitrary application.” Its selection by <i>Princeton 
				Review</i> as one of the “Top 20 LGBTQ-Friendly Colleges and

																					<p align="left">“Sometimes L.G.B.T.Q.I.A. is not enough. At the University of Pennsylvania last fall, eight freshmen united in the frustration that no campus group represented them. Sure, Penn already had some two dozen gay student groups, including Queer People of Color, Lambda Alliance and J-Bagel, which bills itself as the university’s ‘Jewish L.G.B.T.Q.I.A. Community.’ But none focused on gender identity (the closest, Trans Penn, mostly catered to faculty members and graduate students). Richard Parsons, an 18-year-old transgender male, discovered that when he attended a student mixer called the Gay Affair, sponsored by Penn’s L.G.B.T. Center…. ‘This is the L.G.B.T. Center, and it’s all gay guys.’ Through Facebook, Richard and others started a group called Penn Non-Cis, which is short for ‘non-cisgender.’ For those not fluent in gender-studies speak, ‘cis’ means ‘on the same side as’ and ‘cisgender’ denotes someone whose gender identity matches his or her biology, which describes most of the student body. The group seeks to represent everyone else…. On a brisk Tuesday night in November, about 40 students crowded into the L.G.B.T. Center, a converted 19th-century carriage house, for the group’s inaugural open mike. The organizers had lured students by handing out fliers on campus while barking: ‘Free condoms! Free ChapStick!’</p>
																					<p align="left">“…‘There’s a really vibrant L.G.B.T. scene,’ Kate Campbell, one of the M.C.’s, began. ‘However, that mostly encompasses the L.G.B. and not too much of the T. So we’re aiming to change that.’ … She explained that being bi-gender is like manifesting both masculine and feminine personas, almost as if one had a ‘detachable penis.’ … In high school, Kate identified as ‘agender’ and used the singular pronoun ‘they’; she now sees her gender as an ‘amorphous blob.’ … ‘While I definitely knew that I liked girls, I didn’t know that I was one,’ Britt said…. She wasn’t ‘trapped in the wrong body,’ as the cliché has it — she just didn’t know which body she wanted. </p>
																					<p align="left">“…Raised female, Richard [Parsons] grew up in Orlando, Fla., and realized he was transgender in high school… By the time he got to UPenn, he had been binding his breasts for more than two years and had developed back pain. At the open mike, he told a harrowing story about visiting the university health center for numbness and having a panic attack when he was escorted into a women’s changing room. Nevertheless, he praised the university for offering gender-neutral housing. The college’s medical program also covers sexual reassignment surgery… [The University of Pennsylvania] has not always been so forward-thinking [!]; a decade ago, the L.G.B.T. Center (nestled amid fraternity houses) was barely used. But in 2010, the university began reaching out to applicants whose essays raised gay themes.”</div>

				South might be better known for its college basketball team, the 
				Blue Devils. Yet make no mistake about it: Duke belongs in the 
				upper tier of the top universities and colleges nationally. Its 
				best ratings among the ten lists consulted here are <b>fourth</b> 
				(twice: USA Today's <i>College Factual</i>, up slightly from 
				2016's fifth and down slightly from 2015's third; 
				<i>Kiplinger</i>, up from 2016's eleventh and 2015's tenth) and <b>
				seventh</b> 
				(<i>Wall St. Journal/Times Higher Education</i>), with <b>two</b> 
				others rating it <b>eighth</b> (<i>US News </i>[same as last 
				year, except now tied] and<i> College Choice</i>, among national 
				research universities). It is ranked outside the top 10 but 
				still in the ballpark in its 
			<b>eleventh</b> (<i>Niche</i>, down from last year's seventh; in 
				2015 also eleventh) and 
			<b>eighteenth</b> (<i>College Raptor</i>, down from last year's 
				sixteenth) place rankings. Out of the top 10 ballpark are three 
				rankings: <b>twenty-sixth </b>(<i>Forbes</i>, down from last 
				year's twenty-second), <b>thirty-seventh</b> (<i>PayScale ROI</i>, 
				way down from last year's twenty-second), and <b>thirty-ninth</b> 
				(<i>Money</i>, way down from last year's tie for twenty-second).
				<i>US News</i> also ranks Duke #14 (4-way tie) in
				<a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/undergraduate-teaching">
				Best Undergraduate Teaching among National Universities</a>. Duke is ranked <b>twentieth</b>

				<p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst" style="line-height: 200%; margin-right: -.1in" align="left">

				<b>for <i>beginning</i> undergrads</b> receiving any financial 
				aid <b>in 2014-15</b> (sixteenth in 2013-14; using NCES stats 
				that do not factor in private outside scholarships). Broken down 
				into parental salary levels, in 2014-15 for beginning undergrads 
				it ranked <b>forty-sixth for incomes $0-$30,000</b> (2013-14: 
				twenty-second), an impressive <b>third for $30,001-$48,000</b>

				<b>thirteenth</b> (stats not yet available for Harvard and

						Dartmouth in connection with a “Black Lives Matter” 
						protest in which some of the protestors screamed 
						profanities at students studying at the main library for 
						not joining the protest, bullying them, and blocking the 
						movement of one or more students. One administrator 
						apologized not to the students who were intimidated and 
						verbally assaulted but to the protestors, complaining 
						that conservatives were &quot;not nice.&quot; The President issued 
						an initial tepid school-wide email and only later, in 
						response to a media storm, suggested that sanctions 
						might be in order for the protestors (I am not aware of 
						any sanctions being imposed). The incident 
						raises questions about double standards by Dartmouth 
						administrators, particularly against moderates and 
						conservatives, and whether Dartmouth can be a welcoming

				<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amherst College is the 
				first liberal arts college to make our list of top universities 
				and colleges. Its best rankings are understandably in lists that 
				exclude national universities with graduate school programs: <b>
				first</b> in <i>College Choice</i> and 
				<b>second</b> 
				in <i>US News</i> (for the latter, same as last year). In the 
				other lists, its best ratings are 
				<b>sixth</b> (USA Today's<i> College Factual</i>, up slightly 
				from last year's seventh), <b>seventh</b> (<i>Money</i>, up from 
				last year's tie for ninth), <b>twelfth</b> (<i>Forbes</i>, down 
				from last year's ninth), <b>thirteenth</b> (<i>College Raptor</i>, 
				up slightly from last year's fourteenth), and <b>fourteenth</b> 
				(<i>Kiplinger</i>, up from 2016's twentieth and down from 2015's 
				eleventh). Its lowest ratings are
				<b>twenty-third</b> (<i>Wall St. Journal/Times Higher Education</i>), 
				and <b>twenty-eighth</b> (<i>Niche</i>, up from 2016's and 
				2015's thirty-fourth). <i>PayScale</i>'s<i> Return on Investment </i>
				did not give it a rating this year (presumably for insufficient 
				information), though last year it had Amherst ninety-eighth.&nbsp;On 
				the basis of aggregate score minus the single lowest or 
				unregistered score Amherst would be in a tie with Duke for 
				eighth nationally.&nbsp;&nbsp;One could make a reasonable case of ranking 
				Amherst tenth, ahead of Brown, Dartmouth, and Rice. <i>US News</i> 
				also ranks Amherst&nbsp; #13 (4-way tie) in

				In terms of affordability for the past several years Amherst has 
				averaged an impressive <b>eighth in net price</b> when different 
				income levels are factored in and <b>fourth</b> when they are 
				not. Amherst's <b>average student loan at graduation</b> 
				for that portion of the Class of 2015 taking out any loans was
				<b>seventh</b> among the GCR top 133 schools; the <b>percentage 
				of students graduating with debt </b>was the <b>eighth </b>
				lowest. Amherst has <b>a no-loan financial aid package

				representation </b>(second in the GCR top 133; 1.75% more than 
				third-place Duke and the highest percentage among the GCR top 66) 
				and <b>endowment per undergrad</b> (eleventh among all schools).
				<b>It performs rank-wise worst in average mid-career salary </b>
				according to PayScale (eight-way tie for seventy-third); after 
				this the lowest rankings are in <b>absolute endowment</b> 
				(fortieth among all US schools), <b>yield rate</b> (thirty-ninth 
				in the GCR; 40.6%), <b>first-year retention rate</b> (a ten-way 
				tie for thirty-second in the GCR but still 96%), and <b>

				dismal tie for the <b>three hundred eighty-second</b> place in <i>
				PayScale</i>'s <i>Return on Investment</i>, a result that may in 
				part be due to a very small response rate (only 17 alum 
				responding). Its <i>related PayScale Mid-Career Salary</i> 
				rank is sixty-second (tie; but data only for all alumni; 
				insufficient for bachelor's only). With outlier <i>PayScale ROI </i>
				ranking dropped and compared with other schools with lowest or 
				unregistered score dropped, Pomona could rank as high as 
				eleventh in the GCR (tied with Brown and ahead of Dartmouth, 
				Rice, and Vanderbilt). While I am not inclined to put too much 
				weight in this outlier, I also am not inclined to disregard it 
				altogether. <i>US News</i> also ranks Pomona #5 (tie) in

				affordability Pomona ranks high, with an <b>average net price</b> 
				for 2013-14, 2014-15, and 2015-16 of <b>twelfth</b> (when ranks 
				across individual low-income ranges is included) <b>and ninth</b> 
				(when only averages among all income levels are considered). In 
				2015-16, Pomona's net price&nbsp; ranked no lower than sixth for 
				beginning undergraduates receiving any financial aid and no 
				lower than ninth for all undergraduates (factoring in assumed 
				rankings for Harvard and Columbia where no data is yet 
				available). Pomona's<b> average student loan at graduation</b> 
				for that portion of the Class of 2015 taking out any loans was 
				an impressive <b>third</b> among the GCR top 139 schools 
				(though, surprisingly, the percentage of students graduating 
				with debt<b> </b>was only in a 5-way tie for thirty-fourth<b> </b>
				lowest). Pomona does not offer a provision for eliminating 
				parental contribution to students from low-income families but 
				it does provide <b>no-loan financial aid</b> to all students who

					*My endowment ranking counts only individual universities, 
					not university systems like those of the Texas A&amp;M 
					University and the University of Michigan. The Texas A&amp;M 
					University System had an endowment of $10.54 billion in 
					2016. That System comprises 11 universities with 143,000 
					students, along with “seven state agencies, two service 
					units and a comprehensive health science center.” The 
					flagship school at College Station had 63,810 students in 
					2015-16. US News lists the 2015 endowment of the flagship 
					College Station school as $9.754 billion (93% of the system 
					endowment). However,&nbsp;since the student population at College 
					Station is only 44.6% of the system whole, I arrived at a 
					compromise rate of&nbsp;70% of the system endowment: $7.38 
					billion. If one adopted the US News figure, Notre Dame's 
					endowment would rank twelfth in the US. On the other hand, 
					although I rank the endowment for the University of Michigan 
					at Ann Arbor as just ahead of Notre Dame's at $8.957 
					billion, arguably it could be lower, in which case Notre 
					Dame would have the tenth highest endowment in the US. The 
					University of Michigan System had an endowment of $9.74 
					billion in 2016. The flagship University of Michigan in Ann 
					Arbor operates satellite campuses in Flint and Dearborn with 
					a combined student body of 17,500 as compared to the over 
					43,651 student body at Ann Arbor. Since the student body 
					figure for the satellite campuses is 28.7% of the whole and 
					US News gives for the 2015 endowment of the flagship school 
					$9.8097 (98.6% of the system endowment) I compromised with a 
					10% reduction from the system endowment, leaving $8.77 
					billion for Ann Arbor.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">**The only non-US 
					university with a larger endowment is&nbsp; King Abdullah 
					University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia ($20 
					billion in 2013). The next largest endowments outside the US 
					are the University of Cambridge ($7.3 billion in 2014) and 
					the University of Oxford ($5.83 billion in 2015).</p>

			16); University of Chicago will follow next. Northwestern’s best 
			ratings are <b>twice thirteenth</b> (<i>Wall St. Journal/Times 
			Higher Education; </i>USA Today's <i>College Factual</i>, for the 
			second year in a row), <b>fifteenth</b> (<i>Forbes</i>, up slightly 
			from last year's sixteenth), <b>twentieth</b> (<i>College Raptor</i>, 
			down from last year's fifteenth), <b>twenty-fourth</b> (<i>Niche</i>, 
			up significantly from 2016's thirtieth and 2015's twenty-eighth), 
			and its 
			<b>twelfth and sixteenth rating for lists evaluating only national 
			universities</b> (<i>US News</i> [tied; same as last year's rank] 
			and <i>College Choice</i>, respectively). Three of its nine rankings 
			are significantly lower: <b>fifty-ninth
			</b>(<i>Kiplinger</i>, down from 2016's forty-fifth and 2015's 
			fiftieth), 
			<b>sixty-third</b> (<i>PayScale</i>'s <i>Return on Investment</i>, 
			up from last year's seventy-seventh), and <b>seventieth</b> (<i>Money</i>, 
			up from last year's eighty-ninth, tied). In the GCR composite of the 
			six most significant <b>world rankings</b> lists, Northwestern 
			emerges as a respectable <b>twenty-first</b> (sixteenth among US 
			schools).</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst" style="line-height: 200%; margin-right: -.1in" align="left">
			&nbsp;<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards affordability, 
			Northwestern performs significantly below its overall rank, <b>
			averaging fifty-first in net price </b>through various GCR rankings 
			in 2013-14, 2014-15, and 2015-16. In 2014-15 it ranked a 
			surprisingly low sixty-eighth in lowest average net price among the 
			top 133 GCR schools for
			<i>beginning</i> undergrads receiving any financial aid 
			(sixty-second in 2013-14). Northwestern's <b>average student loan at 
			graduation</b> 
			for that portion of the Class of 2015 taking out any loans was an 
			unimpressive<b> fifty-fourth</b> among the GCR top 139 schools; the 
			percentage of students graduating with debt was the sixty-fourth<b> </b>
			lowest (tie). <b>However, we can expect these figures to improve 
			measurably with Northwestern's new financial aid no-loan policy, 
			instituted in Fall 2016</b>. Initial figures for various income 
			levels in 2016-17 suggest a lowering of net price by $3500 over that 
			of 2015-16, which might move NU in rank up about twenty notches.</font></p>

			FIRE reports 
			</a>on speech problems at Northwestern a couple of years ago: &quot;<b>Students 
			and professors who make controversial statements about sex and 
			relationships are at risk of triggering an investigation by 
			bureaucrats dedicated to an overly broad definition of sexual 
			harassment.</b> Laura Kipnis, a professor at Northwestern 
			University, learned this the hard way. After she penned an article 
			for <em>The Chronicle of Higher Education</em> about how the 
			university’s oppressive Title IX bureaucracy was making life worse 
			on campus, students who didn’t like her views filed complaints 
			against her. She was subsequently subjected to an absurd 
			investigation that wasted both her time and the university’s 
			financial resources. And though she was ultimately cleared of any 
			wrongdoing, professors who advocated on her behalf were eventually 
			accused of violating Title IX as well.&quot; For articles on this story

			or tenth, depending on how one treats system endowments at a couple 
			of public universities. My endowment ranking counts only individual 
			universities, not university systems like those of the Texas A&amp;M 
			University ($10.54 billion) and the University of Michigan ($9.74 
			billion). Single institutions should be compared with single 
			institutions. The Texas A&amp;M University System comprises 11 
			universities with 143,000 students, along with “seven state 
			agencies, two service units and a comprehensive health science 
			center.” The flagship school at College Station had 63,810 students 
			in 2015-16. US News lists the 2015 endowment of the flagship College 
			Station school as $9.754 billion (93% of the system endowment). 
			However,&nbsp;since the student population at College Station is only 
			44.6% of the system whole, I arrived at a compromise rate of&nbsp;70% of 
			the system endowment: $7.38 billion. The flagship University of 
			Michigan in Ann Arbor operates satellite campuses in Flint and 
			Dearborn with a combined student body of 17,500 as compared to the 
			over 43,651 student body at Ann Arbor. Since the student body figure 
			for the satellite campuses is 28.7% of the whole and US News gives 
			for the <i>2015</i> endowment of the flagship school $9.8097 (98.6% 
			of the system endowment in 2015, which was $9.952 billion) I 
			compromised with a 10% reduction from the system endowment, leaving 
			$8.77 billion for Ann Arbor.</span></p>

			<font size="5">The University of Chicago, which was founded in 1890 
			by John D. Rockefeller, is
			<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="https://collegeadmissions.uchicago.edu/viewchicago/facts">
			located</a> on a “215-acre campus seven miles south of the main 
			business district of Chicago” in a “neighborhood of Hyde Park, a 
			residential community of 43,000 on the banks of Lake Michigan.” It 
			is the third most highly rated Midwestern school on the GCR, after 
			Notre Dame (no. 16) and Northwestern (no. 20). <b>One can make a 
			strong argument for rating it as the top Midwestern school in the US 
			and, indeed, a top 10 school in the nation as a whole</b> (see 
			below). <b>From an academic standpoint UChicago is clearly a top ten 
			institution of higher learning. </b> <i>Niche</i>, which rates 
			UChicago nineteenth generally (up slightly from 2016's twentieth and 
			down slightly from 2015's eighteenth), elsewhere in
			<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="https://colleges.niche.com/rankings/best-college-academics/">
			a “Best Academics” list</a> 
			puts it at fourth (behind MIT, Stanford, and Yale; ahead of Harvard 
			and Princeton). UChicago's
			<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="https://collegeadmissions.uchicago.edu/academics/faculty">
			website</a> boasts that “the University of Chicago has one of the 
			most distinguished faculties in the world. More Nobel laureates (89) 
			have been associated with UChicago than any other university in the 
			world” (eight of which are current faculty members). “Among other 
			awards associated with current and former faculty and alumni of 
			UChicago” include: 17 John Bates Clark Medalists (economics); 6 
			Fields Medalists (mathematics), two currently on faculty; 29 
			MacArthur “genius” fellows; 12 National Humanities Medal winners; 15 
			National Medal of Science winners; and 20 Pulitzer Prize winners. 
			UChicago has a widely known reputation for having among this 
			nation’s hardest working students (second in this
			<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/colleges-with-the-hardest-working-students-2015-12">
			Niche list</a>; thirteenth in this
			<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=students-study-most">
			Princeton Review list</a>). I’ll note other academic aspects below. 
			In a composite of the six most significant
			<b>world rankings </b> lists UChicago comes out an impressive<b> <i>
			ninth</i></b> (seventh among American schools). </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: 200%; margin-right: -.1in" align="left">
			<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason that it is ranked 
			as low as it is in the GCR (not low in absolute terms but rather 
			relative to what many might expect) receives its simplest 
			explanation in the fact that this is where it lands when ten US 
			college rankings lists are averaged. The most influential college 
			rankings list, that of <b> <i>US News</i>, puts UChicago in a tie 
			for third</b> place with Yale among national universities, but 
			excluding liberal arts colleges (up slightly from 2016's three-way 
			tie for fourth place with Columbia and Stanford).
			<b>
			<i>College Raptor</i> rates it sixth</b> (same as last year's rank). 
			However, 
			<b>none of the other seven rankings lists rates UChicago better than 
			a tie for thirteenth</b> (<i>Wall St. Journal/Times Higher Education</i>); 
			then <b>eighteenth</b> 
			(<i>College Choice</i>, and that among just national research 
			universities), <b>nineteenth</b> (<i>Niche</i>, up slightly from 
			2016's twentieth and down slightly from 2015's eighteenth), and <b>
			twentieth</b> (<i>Forbes</i>, same as previous year). Its mid-range 
			ratings are <b>thirty-eighth</b> (USA Today's <i>College Factual</i>, 
			down slightly from last year's thirty-sixth) and <b>forty-second</b> 
			(<i>Kiplinger</i>, slightly down from 2016's and 2015's fortieth).
			<i>Money</i> gives UChicago the astoundingly low rating of 
			<b>eighty-third</b> (though up significantly from last year's 
			one-hundredth twenty-seventh), no doubt partly as a reflection of 
			its 
			<b>one-hundredth thirty-third</b> 
			ranking by <i>PayScale</i>'s <i>Return on Investment</i> (down 
			significantly from last year's still-low ninety-second rank).</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: 200%; margin-right: -.1in" align="left">
			<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UChicago has a great many 
			things that would qualify it for a top 10 ranking, in addition to 
			the honors accorded its faculty and its reputation for hard-working 
			students. As of 2014-15 it had <b>the highest first-year retention 
			rate</b> in the GCR Top 133 (100%) and the <b>sixth lowest 
			student-to-faculty ratio</b> (5-way tie). As regards standardized 
			test scores, UChicago's Class of 2019 ranked in <b>SAT scores</b> 
			an impressive <b>second</b> (CR+M) <b>and third</b> (CR+M+W [Class 
			of 2018]); in <b>ACT</b> composite score, <b>fourth</b> (5-way tie). 
			For 2016-17 among the GCR top 133 UChicago was an impressive <b>
			seventh </b>in <b>acceptance rate</b>,
			<b>yield</b> <b>rate</b>, and <b>selectivity</b> (desirability) 
			index. It has the <b>thirteenth highest single-institution endowment</b> 
			in the US (fifteenth in the world), though twenty-ninth highest per 
			student. </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: 200%; margin-right: -.1in" align="left">
			<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what accounts for 
			UChicago’s lower-than-expected twenty-first place ranking? Its 
			ranking drops in three main areas usually considered in rankings: 
			graduation rates, financial aid, and average earnings of graduates; 
			to which we add African-American representation. (1) UChicago's <b><i>
			PayScale</i> Mid-Career Salary rank 
			</b>is &quot;only<b>' twenty-first</b>, which is commensurate with its 
			overall rank in the GCR and, to be sure, a significant improvement 
			over its rank in <i>Payscale</i>'s<i> Return on Investment</i>. (2) 
			It has only the <b>
			thirty-third highest 4-and 6-year graduation rates</b> (tied). (3) <b>
			African-American representation
			</b>at UChicago is a paltry <b>sixty-second</b> among the GCR top 
			133. 
			</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: 200%; margin-right: -.1in" align="left">
			<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) As regards 
			affordability, UChicago (like its midwest competitor Northwestern) 
			performs significantly below its overall rank when it comes to <i>
			average</i> net price; but (paradoxically and unlike Northwestern) 
			quite well for students whose families make less than $110,000/year. 
			In <b>2014-15</b> it ranked a surprisingly low<b> eighty-eighth in 
			lowest average net price</b> among the top 133 GCR schools <b>for
			<i>beginning</i> undergrads </b>receiving any financial aid (<b>one-hundred 
			seventh in 2013-14</b>). Yet <b>when considering only parental 
			salary levels below $110,000</b> UChicago does markedly better, 
			averaging <b>
			fourteenth</b>. The enormous disparity between average net cost rank 
			and rankings for different salary levels is puzzling but is probably 
			to be explained by the dearth of financial aid for families that 
			make over $110,000/year (note that the net price goes up from 
			$19,618 for income levels between $75,001 and $110,000 per year to 
			$41,141 for over $110,000/year) and a relatively small number of 
			students in lower income brackets. The &quot;plot thickens&quot; when one 
			considers what &quot;the average University of Chicago aid applicant 
			receives ... in scholarships each year&quot; according to UChicago's 
			admissions page, which would give UChicago a net price rank in the 
			GCR of <b>twenty-ninth</b> for all undergrads receiving any 
			financial aid in 2015-16. Has the net price at UChicago improved so 
			markedly in the past year or two (about $8500 lower) or is there 
			some inaccuracy in figures?
			</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: 200%; margin-right: -.1in" align="left">
			<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UChicago's <b> average 
			student loan at graduation</b> 
			for that portion of the Class of 2015 taking out any loans was only <b>
			thirty-ninth</b> among the GCR top 139 schools (though a significant 
			improvement from the previous year's fifty-seventh rank); the <b>
			percentage of students graduating with debt </b>was the <b>
			eighteenth </b>lowest (5-way tie). In its favor, UChicago does offer <b>
			no-loan financial aid packages </b>for all students who receive 
			need-based aid. This is a new development. Previously UChicago made 
			such an offer only to students from families earning less than 
			$60,000/year.&nbsp; </font></p>

		[south?], Notre Dame, Northwestern, and UChicago). Its best ratings are <b>
		ninth</b> (<i>Niche</i>, up slightly from 2016's twelfth and down 
		slightly from 2015's eighth), <b>eleventh</b> (<i>Wall St. Journal/Times 
		Higher Education</i>), <b>twice nineteenth</b>

		last year's twenty-third), <b>twentieth</b> (<i>College Choice</i>, 
		exclusive of liberal arts colleges), and <b>twenty-first </b>(<i>College 
		Raptor</i>, down slightly from last year's nineteenth). There is a big 
		divide between its top six rankings and its bottom four: 
			<b>fifty-fifth</b> (<i>PayScale</i>'s <i>Return on Investment</i>, 
		up substantially from last year's seventieth rank), <b>fifty-eighth</b> 
		(<i>Kiplinger</i>, down from 2016's fifty-seventh and forty-eighth), 
			<b>sixtieth</b> (<i>Forbes</i>, up slightly from last year's

		(ninth to eleventh in the GCR), <b>overall endowment</b> (fifteenth 
		nationally, though endowment per student is only thirty-first), and <b>
		student-to-faculty ratio</b> (roughly 8 to 1, a 6-way tie for nineteenth 
		in the GCR). Its <b>lowest rankings</b>, save two, are in <b>percentage 
		of African-American students</b> (5.75%, forty-sixth in the GCR) and <b>
		average mid-career salary</b> as estimated by PayScale (forty-seventh 
		nationally). WUSTL's major problem is <b>inadequate financial aid 
		relative to its overall high rank</b>. For 2013-14, 2014-15, and 
		2015-16, it averaged only <b>fiftieth</b> when different income levels 
		were taken into account and <b>seventy-first</b> when considering only 
		average aid.&nbsp;This explains why <b>average student debt</b> at graduation 
		is fifty-eighth lowest (though the percentage of graduates with debt is 
		tied for the thirteenth lowest) and the <b>yield rate</b> 
		is only fifty-fourth.</font></p>

			<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Swarthmore College is the 
			fourth liberal arts college to make the list of the GCR top 133 
			universities and colleges (after Amherst, Pomona, and Williams). 
			This year Kiplinger ranked Swarthmore <b>first</b> in the nation (up 
			from 2016's fifth and 2015's third), an odd rating in view of the 
			fact that no. 3 Princeton surpasses it in all categories but 
			non-need-based aid (Princeton offers only need-based aid). Otherwise 
			its best rankings are in the two rankings lists that exclude 
			national research universities: <b>
			fourth</b> (<i>US News</i>, but excluding national research 
			universities; tied with Middlebury; down slightly from last year's 
			third and no tie) and <b>sixth</b> (<i>College Choice</i>, but 
			excluding national research universities). In other lists its rank 
			varies widely: from <b>tenth</b> (<i>Forbes</i>, down slightly from 
			last year's seventh) and <b>fourteenth</b> (<i>College Raptor</i>, 
			down slightly from last year's twelfth), to <b>thirty-fourth</b> (<i>Wall 
			St. Journal/Times Higher Education</i>) and <b>thirty-eighth</b> (<i>Niche</i>, 
			up dramatically from 2016's eighty-ninth and even 2015's 
			forty-ninth), then to <b>forty-fourth</b> (USA Today's <i>College 
			Factual</i>, down slightly from last year's forty-second) and <b>
			one-hundredth</b> (tie; <i>Money</i>, down from last year's tie for 
			eighty-ninth). Due to low response from Swarthmore alum onto <i>
			PayScale</i>'s website, there is insufficient information to rank in 
			its <i>Return on Investment</i>, though in previous years it 
			averaged sixtieth. <i>US News</i> also ranks Swarthmore #3 (tie) in
			<a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/best-colleges/rankings/national-liberal-arts-colleges/undergraduate-teaching?_mode=list">

		<p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst" style="line-height: 200%; margin-right: -.1in" align="left">
			<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards affordability, 
			Swarthmore provides <b>financial aid</b> <b>roughly commensurate 
			with, or better than, its overall rank</b>. For 2013-14, 2014-15, 
			and 2015-16, it averaged twenty-third when different income levels 
			were taken into account and sixteenth when considering only average 
			aid.&nbsp;It ranks a strong GCR seventeenth for both average student loan 
			at graduation and percentage of students graduating with any debt. 
			Swarthmore has a policy of no-loan financial aid packages.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst" style="line-height: 200%; margin-right: -.1in" align="left">
			<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relative to its overall 
			rank, <b>Swarthmore excels particularly in endowment</b>, both per 
			student (fifth highest in the nation) and total endowment among 
			small liberal arts colleges (sixth nationally); then <b>first-year 
			retention rate</b> (97.5%, thirteenth highest among GCR top 133 
			schools), <b>6-year graduation rate</b> (94%, fifteenth highest in 
			GCR), and <b>student-to-faculty ratio</b> (7.8 to 1, eighteenth 
			lowest in GCR).&nbsp; Swarthmore doesn't have any exceptionally weak 
			rankings relative to its overall rank. It's &quot;worst&quot; rankings are are 
			a respectable yield rate (42%, GCR thirty-eighth) and a relatively 
			strong mid-career salary average for a small liberal arts college 
			(3-way tie for thirty-second nationally, as measured by PayScale).

			<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: 200%; margin-right: -.1in" align="left">
			<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Swarthmore may be a hostile 
			environment for conservatives. It has a reputation for being a very 
			leftwing school even considering the national collegiate trend of 
			leftwing politics. A 2014 article in the <i>
			Daily Caller</i> lists Swarthmore among “<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://dailycaller.com/2014/08/07/the-13-most-rabidly-leftist-politically-correct-colleges-for-dirty-tree-hugging-hippies/">The

			<span style="font-size: 18.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">

			<font size="5">Surprisingly, however, it didn’t make <i>

			Liberal Colleges in America</a>,” in 2017 dropped it entirely from 
			its top 25. Swarthmore has one or more speech codes that &quot;clearly

			<font size="5">Washington and Lee University is the fifth liberal 
			arts college and the fourth-ranked Southern college (behind no. 9 
			Duke, no. 12 Rice, and no. 14 Vanderbilt). W&amp;L is <b>rated fifth by
			<i>Kiplinger</i></b>, largely because of its significant financial 
			aid (down from 2016's first and 2015's fourth). </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst" style="line-height: 200%; margin-right: -.1in" align="left">

			only liberal arts colleges</b> without graduate school programs it 
			is ranked <b>tenth</b> by <i>College Choice </i>and <b>eleventh</b> 
			by <i>US News</i> (up slightly from last year's tie for fourteenth).
			<b>In lists that combine research universities and liberal arts 
			colleges, apart from <i>Kiplinger</i>'s</b>, it nearly always ranks 
			in the twenties or the thirties: <b>twice twentieth</b> (<i>Niche</i>, 
			up from 2016's twenty-seventh and 2015's thirty-eighth; and
			<i>PayScale</i>'s <i>Return on Investment</i>, up slightly from the

			from last year's tie for twenty-fourth), <b>thirty-third</b> (USA 
			Today's
			<i>College Factual</i>, up slightly from last year's thirty-fifth), 
			and <b>thirty-ninth</b> (<i>College Raptor</i>, down significantly 
			from last year's twenty-fifth). The big shocker is that the new <i>
			Wall St. Journal/Times Higher Education </i>rankings list, which 
			incidentally does not take into account financial aid (W&amp;L's 
			strongest feature), places W&amp;L <b>one-hundredth nine</b> (note: in 
			the GCR, a rank from this list is never dropped). Like all liberal 
			arts colleges it is unranked in the major world rankings lists.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst" style="line-height: 200%; margin-right: -.1in" align="left">
			&nbsp;<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>W&amp;L's biggest selling 
			point is its affordability</b>. Across the various categories of 
			rankings over the past few years, its <b>net price has averaged 
			sixth in the GCR</b>, with rank never exceeding fifteenth. W&amp;L has a 
			policy of <b>
			no-loan</b> need-based <b>financial aid packages </b> 
			for all students receiving aid. Students from <b>families that earn 
			less than $75,000/yr get at least free tuition</b>. There is also <b>
			a merit-based full-ride scholarship </b>(at least tuition, room, and 
			board) <b>for one-tenth of the incoming class</b>. It is surprising 
			thenthat its ranking for <b>average student loan at graduation</b> 
			for the Class of 2015 was <b>only forty-fourth</b> among all 139 GCR 
			top schools, though the percentage of students graduating with debt 
			was the eighteenth lowest (5-way). Other strong points are its
			<b>four-year graduation rate</b> (87.87%, seventeenth) and <b>
			endowment per student</b> (nineteenth). Despite being below its 
			overall rank, W&amp;L's <b>mid-career salary&nbsp; average</b> according 
			to PayScale is very good for a small liberal arts college (thirtieth 
			nationally).</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst" style="line-height: 200%; margin-right: -.1in" align="left">
			<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With one exception W&amp;L's 
			lowest rankings are not too far from its overall rank: fifty-ninth 
			in overall endowment (not bad for a small liberal arts college), 
			forty-fifth in yield rate, thirty-eighth in acceptance rate and 
			thirty-sixth in overall desirability, forty-second in first-year 
			retention rate (but still 95.4%), thirty-sixth in 6-year graduation 
			rate (91.7%), and thirty-fifth to thirty-sixth in SAT averages for 
			the class of 2019. The one exception is its ultra-low percentage of 
			African-American students (1.92%, one-hundred twenty-seventh in the 
			GCR 133 top schools). Related to this is the school's problematic
			<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.wlu.edu/presidents-office/issues-and-initiatives/timeline-of-african-americans-at-wandl">
			historical relationship</a> to this sector of the population (the 
			first African American did not matriculate at W&amp;L until 1966). 
			Partly this is due to the school’s Confederate heritage (and 
			namesake Robert E. Lee), which undoubtedly is a turn-off for many 
			potential African-American applicants. The school has set as a goal 
			increasing African-American representation but statistics over the 
			past five years indicate a failure in that goal. The number of 
			African Americans in the entering class in Fall 2012 was ten; in 
			Fall 2013, 2014, and 2016 it was nine each year, with a slight bump 
			to thirteen in Fall 2015. I personally know an African-American 
			applicant from a couple of years ago who was accepted to several Ivy 
			League schools but was put on W&amp;L's wait list.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: 200%; margin-right: -.1in" align="left">
			<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the plus side for 
			moderate-to-conservative applicants is that incoming students will 
			probably find a greater percentage of kindred spirits at W&amp;L than at 
			any other GCR top 25 school. However, even W&amp;L sadly caters to an

			a much higher: fourteenth, up significantly from last year's

			(<i>Forbes</i>, down from last year's thirty-fifth) and <b>
			forty-second</b> (<i>Niche</i>, down significantly from 2016's 
			twenty-eighth and 2015's thirty-second). Two more are in the fifties

			sixth liberal arts college to make the list of top universities and 
			colleges, after no. 13 Amherst, no. 15 Pomona, no. 17 Williams, no. 
			22 Swarthmore, and no. 23 Washington &amp; Lee. Mudd is one of a 
			consortium of five undergraduate liberal arts colleges that comprise 
			the Claremont Colleges and share support services (the others are 
			Pomona, Claremont McKenna, Pitzer, and Scripps). It is the smallest 
			of the schools among the top 133 in the GCR, with about 200 students 
			per entering class, and offers only a Bachelor of Science degree in 
			one of the following majors: engineering (37%), computer science 
			(26%), physics (14%), biology (11%), mathematics (9%), chemistry, a 
			joint program, or an independent study program. Harvey Mudd is not 
			just a technical school. Although students do not major in the 
			humanities, social sciences, or arts, they are required to take 
			courses in these areas. </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst" style="line-height: 200%; margin-right: -.1in" align="left">
			<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mudd's best rankings are 
			<b>third</b> (<i>Pay Scale</i>'s <i>Return on Investment</i>; down 
			slightly from last year's first) and <b>fourth</b> (<i>College 
			Choice</i>, but exclusive of national research universities); then <b>
			fifteenth</b> (USA Today's <i>College Factual</i>, for the second 
			year in a row), 
			<b>twenty-first</b> (tied; <i>US News</i>, but exclusive of national 
			research universities; down from last year's tie for fourteenth), 
			<b>twenty-second</b> (<i>Niche</i>; unranked for insufficient 
			information in the previous year), and <b>twenty-eighth</b> (<i>College 
			Raptor</i>, up significantly from the previous year's fortieth). The 
			remaining rankings are significantly lower: <b>fifty-ninth</b> (<i>Forbes</i>, 
			down slightly from last year's fifty-seventh), <b>sixty-eighth</b> (<i>Kiplinger</i>, 
			compare to 2016's fiftieth and 2015's sixty-eighth), and <b>
			seventy-ninth</b> (tie; <i>
			Money</i>, an oddly precipitous drop from last year's tie for 
			sixth). <i>US News</i> also ranks Mudd&nbsp; #13 (4-way tie) in
			<a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/best-colleges/rankings/national-liberal-arts-colleges/undergraduate-teaching?_mode=list">
			Best Undergraduate Teaching among National Liberal Arts Colleges</a>. It is unranked in the major world rankings lists (contrast 
			Caltech, which is only a little larger, but is highly ranked in 
			world lists).</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst" style="line-height: 200%; margin-right: -.1in" align="left">
			<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mudd's most impressive stat</b> 
			is that it ranks <b>third (tie) in the nation in the <i>PayScale</i> 
			Mid-Career Salary</b>. Other special strengths relative to its 
			overall rank include: <b>very high standardized test scores</b> by 
			the entering class, especially for the ACT (tied for second with MIT 
			and behind only Caltech; for the SAT, ninth and thirteenth); and a <b>
			very high</b>
			<b>first-year retention rate</b> (98%,&nbsp; 9-way tie for third; 
			the rank for 4- and 6-year graduation rates is thirty-ninth and 
			twenty-fifth respectively).
			</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst" style="line-height: 200%; margin-right: -.1in" align="left">
			<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mudd underperforms 
			relative to overall rank so far as net price is concerned</b>. 
			Across the net price categories for 2013-14, 2014-15, and 2015-16 it 
			averages only <b>sixty-fifth</b>. Indeed, in the government NCES 
			Navigator data for 2013-14 and 2014-15 it averages only <b>
			one-hundred thirteenth</b> for beginning undergrads receiving any 
			financial aid. Mudd does not offer no-parental-contribution or 
			no-loan financial aid packages to students from low-income families. 
			Its <b> average student loan at graduation</b> 
			for that portion of the Class of 2015 taking out any loans was an 
			abysmal ninety-third among the GCR top 139 schools.&nbsp;Mudd justifies 
			this from the fact that graduates get great starting salaries that 
			allow them to pay off student loans and cites as proof the zero or 
			near-zero loan default rate.&nbsp;

			<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Other areas needing 
			improvement </b>relative to its overall rank are: a very low in the
			<b>percentage of African-American students</b> (3%, one-hundred 
			twelfth), though with recent improvements now twice that of its 
			rival Caltech (1.43%, one-hundred thirty-third). Even for its small 
			size its <b>endowment</b> is a bit small ($272 million, ranking 
			two-hundred nineteenth nationally; forty-fourth per student).

				<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Middlebury College is 
				our seventh liberal arts college to make the list of the GCR top 
				133 universities and colleges. In northern New England it is the 
				second most highly rated institution after neighboring no. 11 
				Dartmouth College, two ahead of its liberal arts college rival 
				Bowdoin. Not surprisingly its top rankings come from the two 
				lists that assess only liberal arts colleges and exclude 
				national research universities: tied for <b>fourth</b> (<i>US 
				News</i>; same rank as last year) and <b>eighth</b> (<i>College 
				Choice</i>). In lists that consider all universities and 
				colleges, its ranking ranges (with one exception) from eleventh 
				to forty-eighth:&nbsp;
				<b>eleventh</b> (<i>Kiplinger</i>, up from 2016's sixteenth and 
				2015's twenty-first), <b>twenty-seventh</b> (USA Today's <i>
				College Factual</i>, up slightly from last year's 
				twenty-eighth), <b>
				thirty-fourth</b> (<i>Forbes</i>, for the second year in a row),
				<b>thirty-sixth </b>(<i>Wall St. Journal/Times Higher Education</i>),
				<b>thirty-seventh</b> (<i>Niche</i>, up from 2016's forty-second 
				and tied with 2015's thirty-seventh), <b>fortieth</b> (<i>College 
				Raptor</i>, down slightly from last year's thirty-seventh), and
				<b>forty-eighth</b> (<i>Money</i>, up significantly from last 
				year's tie for ninety-sixth). Its ranking in <i>PayScale</i>'s
				<i>Return on Investment</i> is off the charts low (<b>three-hundred 
				seventy-fifth</b> in the nation, though up from last year's 
				five-hundred forty-second) but depends on a relatively small 
				number of respondents. Based solely on the composite score with 
				worst rank dropped, Middlebury would rank twenty-first. <i>US 
				News</i> also ranks Middlebury&nbsp; #19 (3-way tie) in

				<p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst" align="left" style="line-height: 200%">
				<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relative to its overall 
				rank, <b>Middlebury's biggest asset is its financial aid.</b> 
				Although it does not have a no-loan financial aid policy, 
				Middlebury's net price averages out to eighteenth in the GCR top 
				133. This explains why, in spite of using loans in financial aid 
				offers, it has the fourteenth lowest average debt at graduation. 
				Middlebury's <b>lowest rankings </b>are in its<b> mid-career 
				salary average</b> (an abysmal 3-way tie for two-hundred 
				twentieth, though possibly due in part to too few respondents to 
				PayScale's survey), <b>percentage of African-American students
				</b>(3.48%, one-hundred sixth; due in part to the school's 
				location, but contrast nearby Dartmouth's rate which is twice as 
				high),<b> first-year retention rate</b> (7-way tie for 
				sixty-second, though still 94%), and <b>4-year graduation rate</b> 
				(forty-first, though 6-year mark improves to twenty-second).

			eighth liberal arts college to make the list of the GCR top 133 
			universities and colleges, closely following Middlebury College, its 
			liberal arts rival in northern New England. Two of its three top 
			rankings come from the two lists that assess only liberal arts 
			colleges and exclude national research universities: <b>sixth</b> 
				(<i>US News</i>, down slightly from last year's tie for fourth) 
			and <b>eleventh</b> (<i>College Choice</i>). The exception is its <b>
			seventh</b> place ranking in <i>Niche</i> (up from 2016's fifteenth 
			and 2015's thirteenth). In other lists that consider all 
			universities and colleges, its ranking ranges (with one exception) 
			from eighteenth to eighty-second: <b>eighteenth </b>(<i>Kiplinger</i>, 
			compare 2016's twenty-eighth and 2015's thirteenth), <b>nineteenth</b> 
			(<i>Forbes</i>, up slightly from last year's twenty-first), <b>

			for fifty-sixth), <b>forty-fourth </b>(<i>Wall St. Journal/Times

			down significantly from last year's twenty-fourth), and a 
			precipitous drop to <b>eighty-second</b> (USA Today's <i>College 
			Factual</i>, up slightly from last year's eighty-third). Due to 
			sparse response from Bowdoin alum onto
			<i>PayScale</i>'s website, there is insufficient information to rank

			also ranks Bowdoin&nbsp; #22 (5-way tie) in

			($1.3 billion, sixty-third; but impressive per student) <b>and

			still a decent 94%). Its standardized test scores are high for those

			the SAT and 32 for the ACT, putting it about sixteenth to twentieth) 
			but about a third of students did not submit scores.&nbsp; Its <b>

			<font size="5">The University of Virginia is the second public 
			university on the GCR list after UCal Berkeley. It is a school with 
			an historic pedigree. Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James 
			Monroe were key participants in the founding of UVA (first classes 
			began in 1825). Its best rankings are <b>ninth</b> (<i>Money, </i>up 
			substantially from last year's seventeenth), <b>nineteenth</b> (<i>College 
			Raptor</i>, up slightly from last year's twenty-first), <b>
			twenty-second</b> (<i>College Choice</i>, exclusive of liberal arts 
			colleges), and a 3-way tie for
			<b>twenty-fourth</b> (<i>US News</i>, exclusive of liberal arts 
			colleges, up slightly from last year's untied twenty-sixth). Its 
			worst rankings are <b>thirty-sixth </b>(<i>Forbes</i>, for the 
			second year in a row), <b>fortieth </b>(<i>Niche</i>, down 
			significantly from 2016's twenty-fifth and 2015's twenty-third)<b>, 
			forty-third</b> (USA Today's <i>College Factual</i>), 
			<b>forty-sixth</b> (<i>Kiplinger</i>, compare 2016's and 2015's 
			forty-second), <b>fifty-sixth</b> (tie; <i>Wall St. Journal/Times 
			Higher Education</i>), and a particularly low
			<b>one-hundred sixteenth</b> (<i>PayScale</i>'s <i>Return on 
			Investment</i>, down substantially from last year's eighty-eight; 
			but compare in-state fifty-seventh). In the GCR composite list of 
			the top six <b>world rankings</b> it averages <b>
			one-hundred eighteenth</b>&nbsp;&quot;plus&quot; (respectable but not top-tier).</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst" style="line-height: 200%; margin-right: -.1in" align="left">
			<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relative to its overall 
			rank, <b>UVA excels in its four- and six-year graduation rates</b> 
			(88%/eighteenth and 94%/fourteenth, respectively) and its <b>total 
			endowment</b> ($5.85 billion, seventeenth). Its <b>lowest rankings
			</b>are in <b>student-to-faculty ratio</b> (15 to 1, only 
			one-hundred-seventh, tie), <b>average mid-career salary</b> 
			according to PayScale (seventy-sixth), <b>endowment per student </b>
			(sixty-third), and <b>acceptance rate</b> (sixty-first). So far as
			<b>net price </b>is concerned, UVA is <b>a great deal for Virginia 
			residents</b> (in the top 16 among public universities for in-state 
			net price, with a lower net price than any private university in the 
			GCR top 133) but <b>not</b> <b>for out-of-state students in need</b>. 
			Its policies protect free speech, though its promotion of an LGBT 
			agenda indicates some concern for conservatives (3.5 out of five 
			stars according to &quot;Campus Pride&quot;). </font></p>

				<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Davidson College is the 
				eleventh liberal arts college to make the GCR list, behind 
				Amherst, Pomona, Williams, W&amp;L, Mudd, Swarthmore, Middlebury, 
				Bowdoin, Wellesley, and Claremont McKenna. It is a Presbyterian 
				Church (USA) institution. Its strong financial aid is 
				undoubtedly behind its impressive fourth-place rating in <i>
				Kiplinger</i> (significantly up from last year's twenty-fourth). 
				<b>In lists ranking only liberal arts colleges, it ranks ninth</b> 
				(<i>US News</i>, same ranking as the previous year) <b>and</b> a 
				surprisingly low <b>seventeenth</b> (<i>College Choice</i>). 
				Among all colleges 
				<i>Forbes</i> 
				ranks it <b>twenty-fifth</b> (up from 2015's thirty-first) while 
				in five other lists it gets no higher than the forties and 
				fifties: <b>forty-fourth</b> (<i>College Raptor</i>, up slightly 
				from last year's forty-third), <b>forty-fifth</b> (<i>Niche</i>, 
				up significantly from 2016's sixty-ninth), <b>forty-sixth</b> 
				(TIME's <i>Money Magazine</i>, up significantly from 2015-16's 
				fifty-ninth), and <b>fifty-third</b> (<i>College Factual</i>, 
				down slightly from 2015's fifty-first). In the new <i>Wall St. 
				Journal/Times Higher Education </i>it plummets to <b>
				seventy-seventh</b>. There were too few responses from alums to 
				receive a rating in PayScale's <i>Return on Investment</i>. <i>
				US News</i> also ranks Davidson #3 (tie) in

				<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relative to its overall 
				ranking, one of <b>Davidson's strongest features</b> (noted 
				above briefly) is its <b>financial aid</b> where in various 
				categories over the last few years it averages about 
				twenty-third in the GCR. It is tied for the ninth-lowest 
				percentage of graduates with any debt (only 27%) and has the 
				twenty-fifth lowest average student debt at graduation 
				($20,000). In fact, Davidson has the distinction of being the 
				first liberal arts college in the country to offer &quot;no-loan&quot; 
				financial aid packages (2007-8). Its financial aid awards no 
				doubt have something to do with its relatively high <b>yield 
				rate</b> (45.5%, twenty-sixth in the GCR). A remarkable feature 
				of Davidson is its <b>4-year graduation rate</b> (90%, fifth in 
				the GCR; its 6-year grad rate, 93.4%, is a solid twenty-fourth). 
				It also has a fairly high <b>percentage of African-American 
				students</b> (6.76%, twenty-third in the GCR), though behind 
				some other powerhouse Southern schools (Duke, Emory, Vanderbilt, 
				UNC, College of William &amp; Mary).</font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst" style="line-height: 200%; margin-right: -.1in" align="left">
				<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Davidson's <b>lowest 
				ranking features</b> are its PayScale <b>mid-career salary</b> 
				rank (one-hundredth), <b>first-year retention rate</b> 
				(seventy-seventh though still at 93.5%), and, despite its small 
				size, its <b>student-to-faculty ratio</b> (fifty-eighth, though 
				still a respectable 9.6 to 1). The greatest concern for 
				conservative students will be <b>freedom of thought and speech</b>.

				<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colgate University is 
				the twelfth liberal arts college to make the list, behind 
				Amherst, Pomona, Williams, W&amp;L, Mudd, Swarthmore, Middlebury, 
				Bowdoin, Wellesley, Claremont McKenna, and Davidson. Not 
				surprisingly it has its best rankings in lists that evaluate 
				only liberal arts colleges and not research universities: <b>
				twelfth</b> 
				(tie) by <i>US News</i> (though in a 7-way tie; up from last 
				year's tie for nineteenth) and <b>thirteenth</b> by <i>College 
				Choice</i>.&nbsp; In the combined lists, its best ratings are <b>
				twenty-second</b> (<i>Niche</i>, up significantly from 2016's 
				thirty-third), <b>twenty-ninth</b> (<i>College Factual</i>, up 
				slightly from last year's thirty-first), and <b>thirty-second</b> 
				(<i>Kiplinger</i>, done significantly from 2016's and 2015's 
				nineteenth); its worst are
		<b>forty-second</b> (<i>Forbes</i>, down slightly from last year's 
				fortieth), <b>fifty-fourth twice</b> (<i>Wall St. Journal/Times 
				Higher Education</i>; and <i>College Raptor</i>, down from last 
				year's forty-fifth), and <b>fifty-ninth</b> (TIME's <i>Money</i>, 
				down substantially from last year's thirty-fourth).&nbsp;There were 
				too few responses from alums to receive a rating in PayScale's <i>
				Return on Investment</i> (though rated one-hundred eleventh in 
				the previous year).</font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst" style="line-height: 200%; margin-right: -.1in" align="left">
				<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colgate's most notable 
				feature is its <b>relatively strong financial aid</b>, producing 
				rankings between thirteenth and thirty-ninth depending on the 
				category (adding institutions whose stats are not yet available 
				but whose rankings are likely to be better). However, it does 
				not have a no-loan financial aid policy. Colgate also has a&nbsp;
				<b>high PayScale mid-career salary average </b>(twenty-fourth, 
				tied). In terms of ranking, <b>its weakest feature</b> is its <b>
				moderately low percentage of African-American students</b> 
				(4.5%; seventy-eighth); then its endowment per student 
				(fifty-seventh; ninety-fifth in overall endowment), selectivity 
				index (fifty-seventh; sixty-ninth in yield rate), first-year 
				retention rate (fifty-seventh, though still at 94.4%), and 
				six-year graduation rate (90%, fifty-second). Its <b>restrictive 
				speech code</b> is problematic.</font></p>
