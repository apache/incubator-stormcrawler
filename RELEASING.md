# Guide to release Apache StormCrawler

## Release Preparation

- Select a release manager on the dev mailing list. A release manager should be a committer and should preferably switch between releases to have a transfer in knowledge.
- Create an issue for a new release in <https://github.com/apache/stormcrawler/issues>
- Review all [issues](https://github.com/apache/stormcrawler/issues) associated with the release. All issues should be resolved and closed.
- Any issues assigned to the release that are not complete should be assigned to the next release. Any critical or blocker issues should be resolved on the mailing list. Discuss any issues that you are unsure of on the mailing list.

## Steps for the Release Manager

The following steps need only to be performed once.

- Make sure you have your PGP fingerprint added into <https://id.apache.org/>
- Make sure you have your PGP keys password.
- Add your PGP key to the [KEYS](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/stormcrawler/KEYS) file.

Examples of adding your key to this file:

```
pgp -kxa <your name> and append it to this file.
(pgpk -ll <your name> && pgpk -xa <your name>) >> this file.
(gpg --list-sigs <your name>
&& gpg --armor --export <your name>) >> this file.
```

- In a local temp folder, svn checkout the StormCrawler artifacts and update the KEYS file
- Note: This can only be done by an IPMC member. If you are a committer acting as a release manager, ask an IPMC member to add your key.

```
svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/incubator/stormcrawler
svn commit -m "Added Key for <name>" KEYS
```

- Create a Maven `settings.xml` in `~/.m2` to publish to `repository.apache.org`.
- An example configuration can look like:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.1.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.1.0.xsd"
          xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.1.0"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
    <servers>
        <server>
            <id>apache.snapshots.https</id>
            <username>your-asf-ldap</username>
            <password>your-asf-ldap-password</password>
        </server>
        <server>

        </server>
        <server>
            <id>apache.dist.https</id>
            <username>your-asf-ldap</username>
            <password>your-asf-ldap-password</password>
        </server>
    </servers>
    <profiles>
        <profile>
            <id>apache-gpg</id>
            <properties>
                <gpg.keyname>your-gpg-code-signing-key-fingerprint</gpg.keyname>
            </properties>
            <repositories>
                <repository>
                    <id>apache.dist.https</id>
                    <url>https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist</url>
                </repository>
            </repositories>
        </profile>
    </profiles>
</settings>
```

- Note: You can also encrypt related secrets via [Maven build-in methods](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html).

- In case you are running on a headless system, it might be necessary to set the following export before starting with the release preparation.

```bash
export GPG_TTY=$(tty) 
```

## Release Steps

- Checkout the Apache StormCrawler main branch: `git clone git@github.com:apache/stormcrawler.git`
- Execute a complete test: `mvn test` 
  - Ensure to have a working Docker environment on your release machine. Otherwise, coverage computation goes wrong and the build will fail.
- Check the current results of the last GitHub action runs.
- Do a trial build: `mvn package -Papache-release,apache-gpg`
- Switch to a new branch with a format like **rel-stormcrawler-x.y.z-RC?**
- Prepare the release: `mvn release:prepare -Papache-release,apache-gpg` Answer the questions appropriately. The tag name format should be *stormcrawler-x.y.z*. **DO NOT INCLUDE `-rcX` in the tag**
  This command creates and pushes two new commits to the repository to reflect the version changes. It also tags the release and pushes the branch.
- Check the result of the GitHub action runs.

### Successful Maven Release Preparation

#### Perform the Release

- Perform the release: `mvn release:perform -Papache-gpg`
- This creates a staged repository at <https://repository.apache.org/#stagingRepositories>
- Check the staged repository and if all looks well, close the staging repository but do *not* promote or release it at this time.
- The build results are in `stormcrawler/target/`. Do not modify or delete these files.

##### Put the artifacts to dist/dev

- Next, checkout the svn dist dev space from <https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/stormcrawler>
- Create a new folder `stormcrawler-x.y.z-RC1`.
- Add the `apache-stormcrawler-VERSION-incubating-source-release*` files from `stormcrawler/target/` to this folder.
  - `echo "  apache-stormcrawler-3.2.0-incubating-source-release.tar.gz" >> apache-stormcrawler-3.2.0-incubating-source-release.tar.gz.sha512`
  - `echo "  apache-stormcrawler-3.2.0-incubating-source-release.zip" >> apache-stormcrawler-3.2.0-incubating-source-release.zip.sha512`
- Ensure to add the file name to the `sha512` signature of the `apache-stormcrawler-VERSION-incubating-source-release*.zip.sha512` file as this is not automatically done via Maven.
- Commit the change set to the dist area (commit message "adding X.Y.Z-RC1"). Check that the files are present in <https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/stormcrawler/stormcrawler-x.y.z-RC1>

#### Check the Release Artifacts

Perform basic checks against the release binary:

- Check signature of generated source artifacts. This can be done like that:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

mkdir /tmp/test
cd /tmp/test
curl -s -O https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/incubator/stormcrawler/KEYS
curl -s -O https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/stormcrawler/stormcrawler-x.y.z-RC1/apache-stormcrawler-x.y.z-incubating-source-release.tar.gz
curl -s -O https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/stormcrawler/stormcrawler-x.y.z-RC1/apache-stormcrawler-x.y.z-incubating-source-release.tar.gz.asc

echo "
list keys
"
gpg --homedir . --list-keys

echo "
import KEYS file
"
gpg --homedir . --import KEYS

echo "
verify signature
"
gpg --homedir . --output  apache-stormcrawler-x.y.z-incubating-source-release.tar.gz --decrypt apache-stormcrawler-x.y.z-incubating-source-release.tar.gz.asc
```

- Check presence and appropriateness of `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, `DISCLAIMER` and `README.md` files.

### Prepare the Website

- Create a separate branch for the release.
- Run a global replace of the old version with the new version.
- Prepare a preview via the staging environment of the website.
- Ensure the website is updated on <https://stormcrawler.staged.apache.org>
- Note: Instruction on how to do so can be found on <https://github.com/apache/stormcrawler-site>

### Create a draft release on Github

- Create a new Draft Release -- on <https://github.com/apache/stormcrawler/releases>, click `Draft a new release` and select the `stormcrawler-X.Y.Z` tag.
- Click the `Generate Release Notes` (**MAKE SURE TO SELECT THE CORRECT PREVIOUS RELEASE AS THE BASE**). Copy and paste the Disclaimer and Release Summary from the previous release and update the Release Summary as appropriate.
- Click the `Set as pre-release` button.
- Click `Publish release`. The release should not have `*-rc1` in its title, e.g.: `https://github.com/apache/stormcrawler/releases/tag/stormcrawler-3.2.0`

#### Create a VOTE Thread

The VOTE process is two-fold:

- (1) Create a community vote on <dev@stormcrawler.apache.org>
- (2) If this vote is successful, the actual vote can be started on <general@incubator.apache.org>

- Be sure to replace all values in `[]` with the appropriate values.
